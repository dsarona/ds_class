# Prediciting Targetted Attacks

## Problem Statement
* Limited security resources to monitor and respond to attacks on a growing number of hosts and services
  * Virtual and Cloud solutions reducing deployment time and overhead - growth of the devops model
  * No easy model for identifying at risk services once they are deployed
  * Need to automate as much as possible - no time for manually reviewing data
