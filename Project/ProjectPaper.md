## Problem statement and hypothesis
Limited security resources to monitor and respond to attacks on a growing number of hosts and services
Virtual and Cloud solutions reducing deployment time and overhead - growth of the devops model (instant deployment)
No easy model for identifying at risk services once they are deployed - why are some hosts compromised and not others
Need to automate as much as possible - no time for manually reviewing data

## Description of your data set and how it was obtained
Public data on service and hosts

Shodan
Info for an ASN
Firewall data on network connections

Query by 'live' IP's collected in step one
Organized by GEO, Port dst, and frequency

## Description of any pre-processing steps you took
* Key fields to be used (y and x)
* Identification of null fields
* Combining into one doc

## What you learned from exploring the data, including visualizations
* Grouping by port
* Grouping by HTTP response
* Grouping by ASN
* Grouping by parent domain

## How you chose which features to use in your analysis

## Details of your modeling process, including how you selected your models and validated them

## Your challenges and successes

## Possible extensions or business applications of your project

## Conclusions and key learnings
