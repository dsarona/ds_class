## Problem statement and hypothesis
Limited security resources to monitor and respond to attacks on a growing number of hosts and services
Virtual and Cloud solutions reducing deployment time and overhead - growth of the devops model (instant deployment)
No easy model for identifying at risk services once they are deployed - why are some hosts compromised and not others
Need to automate as much as possible - no time for manually reviewing data

## Description of your data set and how it was obtained
